## What can it do

Short Touch allows you to have 6 shortcuts on your touch bar that are somewhat easily accessible at the click of a button. Unfortunately, there are some limitations of the the touch bar api, such as the fact that it's only present whilethe app is open. It acts more of a quick launcher rather than a permanent solution for your TB. Also the shortcuts right now only support URLs to open in safari, working on getting it to open apps and links inside other browsers (Chrome).

## Install

\*Currently this is still in beta/development and can only be installed by cloning the repo and manually installing it.

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
